## INSTRUCTIONS FOR VOTE COUNTER 2.0

So, we messed up. Bad.
Remember that election you helped out with last week?
Yeah, turns out there was a miscommunication somewhere along the way.

Turns out that the special election for comptroller was supposed to be a "ranked choice" election.
Have you heard of those before?
When people vote, they can choose multiple candidates on a single ballot, and rank them in order of preference.
Like, I could vote for Jim in my first place spot, Tim in my second place spot, and Clem in my third place spot.

Yeah...that's how the votes were *supposed* to be counted. We uh, missed the memo on that.
So we need you to re-count the votes. We've sent you a new file that has each ballot on a separate line.
You'll see three candidates in each ballot. The first one named is the first choice,
the second one named is the second choice, and the third one named is the third choice.

When it comes to counting the votes, the **first choice should count as 3 votes,**
**the second choice should count as 2 votes, and the third choice should count as 1 vote.**

At the very least, we were able to salvage your method of picking out the winner and tweak it for this new `vote-counter-2.0.py`.
You'll just need to actually compute the scores based on the above guidelines.

Well, best of luck.
