# CITIZEN RANK SPECIFICATIONS

IN ORDER TO ATTAIN ANY GIVEN RANK,
THE CITIZEN IN QUESTION MUST MEET *ALL* MINIMUM THRESHOLDS
ACROSS THE FOUR CATEGORIES MEASURED.

E.G., IF A CITIZEN HAS ACHIEVED THE RANK OF "3" IN TERMS OF
ACTIVE TIME, CODE LINES WRITTEN, & QUALITATIVE WORDS WRITTEN,
BUT HAS ONLY ACHIEVED RANK "5" IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF COMMITS,
THAT CITIZEN WOULD BE BE ASSIGNED A RANK OF "5".
